# About the code

## What does this code do?

The code filter all numbers in the list of strings (example ["1", "3", "6", "43", "grape", "6", "ABC"])converts it to integers, and return the number of odds. 

## My thoughts when I made this code

First of all, I just started learning Elixir and the functional paradigm (which I am in love with) and I wanted to make this code the most verbose as possible on purpose to learn properly how a function interacts with each other, understand more about recursive functions and fix other concepts. Check the commits to see the difference.

I will refactor the code to make it the smallest and most complex as possible to learn and fix some intermediate/advanced concepts. So if you are interested in my evolution keep an eye on this repo! :smile:

P.S.: I will make some exercises of the [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/elixir) and post them here. So if you are interested in Elixir and are in the beginning stages of learning, this is a good profile to follow up too!
